WIRED on the [Life Clock](http://www.thelifeclockapp.com/) app for the Apple Watch:

> Here's one way the Apple Watch could help you live a fuller life: by counting down the seconds until you croak.

Steve Jobs:

> Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

> Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
