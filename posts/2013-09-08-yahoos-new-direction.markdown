Along with a good portion of the rest of the internet, I read [Marissa Mayer's post about the new Yahoo logo](http://marissamayr.tumblr.com/post/60336044815/geeking-out-on-the-logo). There's been a lot of talk about the logo since then, and for what it's worth: I like the new logo more than the old one, and I think that it is notable that they decided to buck the "flat" design trend by giving it some depth.

However, what Mayer's post really got me thinking about was: how has Yahoo changed since she took over?

Obviously, in addition to the new logo, they're getting a lot more attention from the tech media, and they've made a [bunch of acquistions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Yahoo!#Acquisitions).

But how has all this actually affected their web presence? I decided to take a look at the Yahoo homepage this evening, and compare it to the Yahoo homepage on the eve of the day Mayer was named CEO. Take a look:

Yahoo Homepage as of July 15th 2012:

<a href="/img/yahoo-homepage-2012-07-15.png" data-lightbox="image-1" title="Yahoo Homepage 2012-07-15"><img src="/img/yahoo-homepage-2012-07-15.png" alt="Yahoo Homepage 2012-07-15" width="500"></a>

Yahoo Homepage as of September 8th 2013:

<a href="/img/yahoo-homepage-2013-09-08.png" data-lightbox="image-2" title="Yahoo Homepage 2013-09-08"><img src="/img/yahoo-homepage-2013-09-08.png" alt="Yahoo Homepage 2013-09-08" data-lightbox="image-2" title="Yahoo Homepage 2013-09-08" width="500"></a>

Although the pages have very different visual feels, there has been little substantive change: the layout and content are nearly identical.

The biggest difference is the introduction of the navigation bar similar to Google's at the top of today's page. This seems to represent a shift in focus from being a content provider to more of an application provider like Google is.

In the last year or so, Yahoo has redesigned Flickr and Mail and acquired a bunch of other "apps" (the most prominent of which being Tumblr.) However, none of the acquisitions seem to have made a dent in the homepage yet.

So, even though Yahoo has a new logo to go with its new look and feel, it still seems to be more or less the same site--even after all the acquisitions. This might change, but for now it seems that the changes at Yahoo are mostly skin-deep.
